1. Binary Search: Implement a program to search and find student details in an efficient matter.
Reduce the number of comparisions as much as possible. Use student's reg no as the key (int).
Store student name, reg no, CGPA in the list of student's details

2. Binary Search Application: Implement a program to find the square root of a number.
User can give the number randomly. Floor the result in case of floating point.

3. Bubble Sort: Sort the given array of elements in ascending order
and print out the number of comparisons performed.

4. Insertion Sort: Sort the given array of elements in ascending order
and print out the number of comparisons performed.

5. Selection Sort: Sort the given array of elements in ascending order
and print out the number of comparisons performed.

6. Quick Sort: Sort the given array of elements in ascending order
and print out the number of comparisons performed.

7. Merge Sort: Sort the given array of elements in ascending order
and print out the number of comparisons performed.

8. Compare the number of comparisons of various sorting algorithms
mentioned in above questions 3-6. Print a table which shows the
input array, and number of comparisons performed by various
algorithms. Reuse above sorting programs as functions in this new
program.
